# Data Cleaning & Insights Generation on Surat's Housing Dataset
This project focuses on cleaning and analyzing a housing dataset from Surat, India to derive meaningful insights for potential buyers, sellers, and real estate stakeholders. The raw dataset contained inconsistencies, missing values, and outliers, which were systematically cleaned using Python. Once cleaned, the dataset was explored to uncover meaningful patterns and trends in Suratâ€™s real estate market, including property type distributions, location-based pricing, and the relationship between property size and price per square foot.
